# x509tools

This package contains several x509-related helper functions not found in the
standard library (albeit, perhaps they should be).

Large portions of this logic was take directly from the crypto/x509 package
and thus this package maintains the same copyright and license as the Go
source code itself. See the file "LICENSE" for more information.
